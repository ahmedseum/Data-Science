https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/politics/8itmnjnojh,No point in repeatedly highlighting national issues abroad: Amir Khasru,https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/politics/8itmnjnojh,"Bangladesh Nationalist Party standing committee member Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury said on Friday there is no point in repeatedly discussing the country’s problems abroad. Discussions must take place within the country as the solution lies with the people of Bangladesh, he remarked. Amir Khasru said this while speaking as the chief guest at a discussion at the LGED auditorium in Muradpur, Chattogram, marking the 44th death anniversary of former President Ziaur Rahman this afternoon . Without taking anyone’s name in his speech, the BNP leader said, “It is better to speak within the country. Rather than speaking excessively abroad, it is more effective to speak inside the country. After all, this is Bangladesh’s problem. Talking about it abroad will not help.” According to him, “We must speak up within Bangladesh and find a solution here, right? If we keep going abroad to talk about these issues, will that solve Bangladesh’s problems? No, it won’t. The discussion has to happen here; the solution is here. The solution lies with the people of Bangladesh.” Emphasising that the people are the solution to all problems, Amir Khasru said, “At the end of the day, whether it’s reform or justice or anything else, the solution lies with the people of Bangladesh. There is no second force that can offer a solution. The only force is the people of Bangladesh.” Mentioning the wait for elections, the senior BNP leader stated that until an elected government comes to power through elections, it will not be possible to implement anything meaningful. A democratically elected government is needed in Bangladesh as soon as possible. Whether any particular party wants this or not is not a big issue. The people of Bangladesh are hoping for democracy. Asking the party leaders and activists to move past minor disagreements, Amir Khasru said that if Bangladesh is to be properly built in line with the vision of Khaleda Zia and Ziaur Rahman, party members must act with urgency and momentum. “If we lose that momentum, it will not work. We have to let go of minor internal disputes,” he added. Chattogram city BNP organised the event, which was presided over by city BNP convener Ershad Ullah and conducted by member secretary Nazimur Rahman. Professor SM Abdul Awal, vice-chancellor of Pabna University of Science and Technology, was the keynote speaker while BNP central organising secretary Mahbubur Rahman was the special guest. Earlier in the morning, defying the rain, leaders and activists of BNP and its affiliated bodies laid floral tributes at the first grave of Ziaur Rahman in Rangunia.",NA

""It is the expatriates who help sustain the country (by sending their remittances in hard time),"" he said while speaking at a community reception at the Bangladesh Embassy in Tokyo. Prof Yunus said the ousted government left the state exchequer and banks empty and if the expatriates would not support, Bangladesh would not have turned around.  He said the interim government will, of course, perform the responsibilities bestowed upon it but the participation of the Bangladesh expatriates should be strengthened in nation building.  The Chief Adviser asked them to take initiatives to increase business in Bangladesh.  ""As a citizen, you must take the responsibility of the state repair,"" he said. The expatriates have relatives and friends in Bangladesh and they have businesses there too and that is why they often visit the country, Prof Yunus said. ""So, overall we have to work together ... you should increase your influence on the Japan government,"" he said.  On the occasion, three exchange of notes were signed later, respectively on the Development Policy Loan for Economic Reform and Strengthening Climate Change Resilience (418 million USD), the Loan for the Joydebpur-Ishwardi dual-gauge double-lane railway project (641 million USD) and the grant for the human development scholarship (4.2 million USD). Bangladesh Ambassador to Japan Md Daud Ali and Japanese Ambassador to Bangladesh Shinichi Saida signed the agreements on behalf of the respective sides.

https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/politics/4q19es82se,Left Democratic Alliance demands election by December,https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/politics/4q19es82se,"Bam Gonotantrik Jote (the Left Democratic Alliance) has called for holding the national elections within the upcoming December. In a statement on Friday afternoon, the alliance said, “The claim that no one but one party wants elections in December is far from the truth. Bam Gonotantrik Jote considers such remarks to be misleading and purposeful.”  The statement noted that it is not just one party, but more than 50 political parties, both registered and unregistered, want the general elections to be held in December. The alliance demanded that the necessary electoral reforms be carried out soon, the election be held within December as per people’s aspiration, and the power be handed over to the elected government. They alleged that the interim government has adopted the evil strategy of delaying the election, in order to implement the agenda of American imperialism and to politically favour a new party formed with state backing. The statement further noted that a newly formed political party along with certain extreme communal groups and parties, including some war criminals and perpetrators of crimes against humanity from 1971, are creating anarchy in the country, to foil the upcoming election. These actions, the alliance warned, could plunge the country into a dangerously volatile situation. The statement was jointly issued by Iqbal Kabir Zahid, central coordinator of the alliance and general secretary of the Revolutionary Communist League of Bangladesh; Shah Alam, president of the Communist Party of Bangladesh (CPB); Ruhin Hossain, its general secretary; Bazlur Rashid Firoz, general secretary of the Socialist Party of Bangladesh (BASAD); Masud Rana, coordinator of BASAD (Marxist); Mushrefa Mishu, general secretary of the Democratic Revolutionary Party; and Abdul Ali, executive president of the Socialist Party of Bangladesh.",NA

https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/city/0kb170y11o,"Homes under waist deep water, slum dwellers take shelter under flyover",https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/city/0kb170y11o,"Some of the houses are submerged under waist deep water while some are nearly chest-deep underwater. The waterlogging caused by heavy rainfall has led to this situation at Kalshi Balur Maath slum in Dhaka’s Mirpur area. Under such conditions, several hundred people from the slum have taken refuge under the Kalshi flyover. While visiting the area around 10:30 am today, Friday, slum dwellers were found gathered under the flyover. The slum was submerged from the incessant rainfall throughout the day and night on Thursday. That’s why the people living in that slum have taken shelter under the flyover. They said that they have been sheltering there since 11:00 pm last night. A large crowd of several hundred people was seen under the flyover. Some were sitting on the ground while some were just standing. A few were snacking on puffed rice and molasses, carried in polythene bags. Some had laid out their wet mattresses and rugs to dry on the raised landing under the flyover. To save their belongings, many brought household appliances like televisions and refrigerators there with them. When spoken to at least 15 slum dwellers who had taken refuge under the flyover, they revealed as the rainfall intensified in the evening, water started seeping into their homes. By 9:00 to 10:00 pm, water had risen to knee level in many houses. In this condition the slum dwellers started shifting under the flyover around 11:00 pm. Many also sought shelter with relatives living nearby. A woman, Shirin Akhter, lives at Kalshi Balur Maath slum with her husband, mother-in-law, and two daughters. Their home is near the lowest part of the slum. Shirin said the water had already reached waist level in their home on Thursday night. When she returned briefly around 8:00 am this morning, the water appeared to have risen even more. She has not gone back since. Shirin said they have been sheltering under the flyover since 11:00 pm last night. Their beds, mattresses, and furniture were all soaked heavily. They managed to bring only a few dry clothes with them. Her family spent the night eating bananas and breads, she mentioned. A man named Mohammad Kalam, lives in the middle part of the slum with his wife Jasmine and daughter Jannat. He said they left their home around 12:00 pm on Thursday. Their home was still under knee-deep water this morning. Like the other family, they also could not salvage anything else from their house except for a few dry clothes. Around 450 families live in the Kalshi Balur Maath slum. According to affected residents, hundreds of people from the families living in the slum spent Thursday night under the Kalshi flyover. Many left for work straight from there this morning while others returned home to try to salvage belongings. Members from several families were taking turns to keep watch for preventing theft, they said. In one corner under the flyover, dry food such as puffed rice and molasses was being distributed among the dwellers of the slum. It was found that the aid came from a man named Mohammad Mintu. Mohammad Mintu, present at the scene told Prothom Alo that he is the organisational secretary of BNP for unit no. 10, ward no. 5, in Pallabi. Mintu said he had been to the site on Thursday night but could not do anything for those people then. Acting on party instructions, today he distributed dry food in the morning and made arrangements for cooked meals such as khichuri for the afternoon. Around 11:00 am today, people were seen taking preparations for cooking khichuri under the flyover. The slum is located near Kalshi intersection on a stretch of low-laying land down the slope of the street. This correspondent tried to enter the slum going around the Baitul Moeen Jame Mosque after 11:00 am today. He found himself in knee-deep water within just 10 metres of moving towards the slum and was forced to turn back. Slum residents reported that they had not seen any workers from Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) working to drain the water in the area since Thursday night till 11:00 on Friday morning. However around 10:00 am, DNCC’s public relations department told Prothom Alo, 99 members from their quick response team under DNCC zone no. 10 along with 50 labourers were working to solve the waterlogging problem there. They were using old-fashioned tools to remove the water. The public relations department further stated that the DNCC launched a control room on Thursday night to receive reports of waterlogging across the city. As of 10:00 am today, they had received 28 complaints and were working to defuse the waterlogging situation in 29 sites across DNCC zone no. 10.",NA

This correspondent tried to enter the slum going around the Baitul Moeen Jame Mosque after 11:00 am today. He found himself in knee-deep water within just 10 metres of moving towards the slum and was forced to turn back. Slum residents reported that they had not seen any workers from Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) working to drain the water in the area since Thursday night till 11:00 on Friday morning. However around 10:00 am, DNCC’s public relations department told Prothom Alo, 99 members from their quick response team under DNCC zone no. 10 along with 50 labourers were working to solve the waterlogging problem there. They were using old-fashioned tools to remove the water. The public relations department further stated that the DNCC launched a control room on Thursday night to receive reports of waterlogging across the city. As of 10:00 am today, they had received 28 complaints and were working to defuse the waterlogging situation in 29 sites across DNCC zone no. 10.",NA

It stated that the way the Awami League government initiated a flawed war crimes trial process to serve its narrow party interests, the interim government is now protecting Jamaat’s interests in the same spirit. The Ganatantrik Odhikar Committee said this in a statement issued today, Friday, in response to the acquittal of former acting secretary general of Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, ATM Azharul Islam, from his death sentence in the case filed on charges of committing crimes against humanity in 1971. The statement was issued on behalf of committee members including Professor Anu Muhammad, Haroon Ur Rashid, Seema Dutta, Samina Luthfa, Abdullah Al Kafi, Fakhruddin Kabir Atik, Maha Mirza, Afzal Hossain, and Marzia Prova. “In an Appellate Division review hearing, ATM Azhar, a known war criminal and Jamaat leader sentenced to death by the International Crimes Tribunal, was declared innocent and acquitted of all charges unconditionally. The adviser to the law ministry dubbed this verdict as just. We want to say that exonerating a known war criminal by declaring him completely innocent is not justice; rather this serves as an example of political influence over the judiciary,” the statement said. Mentioning that ATM Azhar was Islami Chhatra Sangha’s Rangpur district committee chief and the leader of the Al-Badr force during the liberation war in 1971, the Ganatantrik Odhikar Committee said Azhar, along with Jamaat, Al-Badr, and Islami Chhatra Sangha, stood with Pakistan in the war and was involved in genocide, rape, and crimes against humanity. The historical evidence of Jamaat’s role in the genocide shows that Azhar, due to his organisational position, was a complicit. However, from the start, the International Crimes Tribunal did not follow the fundamental principles of trying genocide, choosing instead to prosecute individuals rather than the organisations like Jamaat, Al-Badr, Al-Shams, and Chhatra Shibir. Claiming that global standards for prosecuting genocide were not followed, the committee added, “What is surprising is that although the interim government admitted the flaws in the tribunal’s proceedings, it still pursued an appeal review within the same flawed process. We assert that just as the Awami League government launched this flawed trial process to serve its narrow political interests, the interim government is now continuing that legacy by preserving Jamaat’s interests.” The statement further claimed that the interim government structured the ICT in such a way that several prosecutors, including the chief prosecutor, had previously served as defence lawyers for war crimes accused. This created a conflict of interest that influenced the verdict. Additionally, the current state lawyers refused to take responsibility for the previous prosecution’s failures, which not only constituted professional misconduct but also weakened the entire judicial process. The current prosecution had a duty to correct past mistakes and defend the state. In such a circumstance, declaring the accused innocent and acquitting him unconditionally of charges is a mockery in the name of justice. The committee remarked that the July mass uprising had generated hopes for democracy, justice, and an independent judiciary, but the acquittal of Jamaat leader Azhar goes against those hopes and effectively ensures that the July massacre will not be prosecuted. Referring to the brutal attack by Islami Chhatra Shibir, Jamaat’s student wing, on students protesting the verdict under the banner of the Ganatantrik Chhatra Jote (Democratic Students Alliance), the committee noted that several students were seriously injured. They also said Shibir is now repeating the pattern of attacks that the Bangladesh Chhatra League carried out against student protests over the past 15 years. Female students were specifically targeted, and in Sylhet, a female student was repeatedly threatened by Shibir members for speaking out. This pattern of behaviour proves Chhatra Shibir, raised under the patronage of the Chhatra League for 15 years, is now carrying the same fascist ideology and behaviour of the Awami League, it added. The Ganatantrik Odhikar Committee demanded an immediate correction and restructuring of the flawed International Crimes Tribunal complying with the fundamental principles of genocide prosecution, to enable trials of both Jamaat and Awami League for their roles in the genocide. It also called for the identification and prosecution of Chhatra Shibir members involved in attacks on peaceful demonstrations.",NA

It said that Gono Forum has been demanding that reforms necessary for free, fair and credible elections  be carried out so the election could be held in December. Gono Forum's presidium council meeting was held in the afternoon today, Friday, at the party's central office. Presidium council member SM Altaf Hossain chaired the meeting which was also attended by the party's general secretary Md Mizanur Rahman, presidium council members Subrata Chowdhury, Jaglul Haider Afrik, Mesbahuddin, Mustaq Ahmed, Suraiya Begum, Selim Akbar, Shah Nuruzzaman and others. A press release of Gono Forum, outlining the issues discussed in the meeting, stated that the statements made by the chief advisor and other advisors regarding the election appeared vague and confusing. This was creating a division among active political parties. Gono Forum leaders said that to reap the benefits of the mass uprising, it is essential to establish democracy, the rule of law, and voting rights in the country. The government has failed to adopt a clear framework for the necessary reforms or implement any concrete plans to this end. It is unfortunate that the blame for this failure is being shifted onto political parties. The party also noted that recent discussions about the resignation of the chief advisor and meetings between the government and certain political parties have further disheartened the nation. Gono Forum stated that the government’s decision not to invite them to the latest meeting between the chief adviser and political parties indicates an attempt to create divisions among active political forces. Gono Forum leaders further stated that in the past nine months, the government had failed to take effective steps to restore law and order and resolve instability in public administration. Additionally, no necessary reforms or visible efforts had been made to ensure free, fair, and credible elections. As a result, public support for the government was declining, while distrust was growing both among political parties and in the public mind. At the meeting of the Gono Forum presidium council, a demand was made for the immediate announcement of a concrete election roadmap. It also called on all to remain vigilant so that the national unity forged through the mass uprising in July to establish democracy and good governance in the country was not destroyed by any evil forces.",NA

https://en.prothomalo.com/opinion/op-ed/9rlff8f5j1,The crucial task of nation-building that Zia carried out,https://en.prothomalo.com/opinion/op-ed/9rlff8f5j1,"Zia was not a flamboyant or grand personality like Sukarno, Nasser, Ben Bella, and Nkrumah, yet he left behind a party and an ideology that continue to shape the course of Bangladesh’s history to this day. Today, 30 May, is the 44th death anniversary of the former president Ziaur Rahman. It was on this day that he was assassinated by scheming army officers at the Circuit House in Chattogram. Every year this day arrives with a new message, a new significance for the people. The people of Bangladesh, amid all disaster, learn new lessons from the life and work of Ziaur Rahman. I feel that the greatest achievement of Ziaur Rahman, during his less than six-year rule, was the creation of Bangladeshi nationalism. This was a monumental task, though he managed to carry it out in a very short span of time. We know of many nationalist leaders in the political arenas of post-colonial Asia and Africa. Sukarno, Nasser, Ben Bella, and Nkrumah were towering figures in the anti-colonial struggles of their respective countries. Many of them remained in power for long periods and enjoyed international acclaim. They made significant contributions to the task of nation-building.Yet, after their deaths, the people did not adhere to their ideologies. The state ideals they had established did not endure once they left power. However, in the case of Zia, it was quite different. Zia was not a flamboyant or grand personality like them, yet he left behind a party and an ideology that continue to shape the course of Bangladesh’s history to this day.His Bangladeshi nationalism has taken deep root in the hearts of the people and has transformed into a powerful tangible force. How so? While acknowledging the limitations of historical categorisation, the history of decolonisation can be divided into four stages. These stages are: the emergence and consolidation of nationalist movements; the victory of these movements; the subsequent state formation following the success of the movements; and the stage of defining the state’s relationship with other states and with the unequal social structure within, and ensuring the stability of these relationships. In most cases, our focus has remained confined to the second and third stages. However, in reality, the most significant turning points in social transformation have occurred in the first and fourth stages. In the context of Bangladesh’s decolonisation, Zia was involved in the third and fourth stages. The generally belief is “seek ye first the political kingdom,” and that “the nationalists could make the state, and the state could make the nation.” But in Bangladesh's case, there was little room for nurturing such illusions, even though the vast majority of the population shared a common language and a thousand-year history. With the exit of the Pakistan army, we did indeed gain a national flag, a national anthem, and a government. But we mortgaged our national sovereignty to India as the price for their support and assistance during our war of independence. We were compelled to keep our armed forces small in size and weak in every respect to repay our “debt of gratitude” to India. The development of a strong military could have been construed as a sign of hostility toward India. Soon after Bangladesh’s emergence, India revealed the tiger claws it had kept hidden. India's ulterior designs included the withdrawal of water from common rivers, the unequal agreements regarding enclaves, the proposal to send Indian bureaucrats to help run Bangladesh’s administration and more. Countries that have depended on foreign military forces for their national liberation or deliverance have typically attained only limited sovereignty. The nations of East Europe in the post–World War II era stand as strong evidence of this. It was through a symbolic act that Ziaur Rahman upheld the flame of our full national sovereignty. In October 1975, as army chief, Zia handed over a pistol seized from an Indian army commander during the 1965 Pakistan-India war, to a unit of the Bengal Regiment. This was a significant symbolic message from Zia to both the soldiers and the people. Thus, on 7 November 1975, at a moment of grave national crisis, soldiers and civilians came together to free Zia from the conspirators’ captivity and entrusted him with the responsibility of leading the state. This victory gave the people a sense of security and reassurance. As head of state, Zia redefined the nature of Bangladesh’s relations with other countries. He fostered friendly cooperation with China. Deep ties were established with Muslim countries of the OIC. Bangladesh became a respected member of the Al-Quds Committee and took on a mediating role between the warring nations of Iran and Iraq. In the Western world, Zia clarified Bangladesh’s true position as a non-aligned country and resolved prevailing misunderstandings. Even our hostile neighbour India signed a five-year water-sharing treaty with a guarantee clause, which reduced tensions. This was because Zia had succeeded in mobilising public opinion regarding Bangladesh’s rightful claims. Bangladesh earned the dignity of being an independent and sovereign nation. From the experience of the last 44 years we now know that creating Bangladesh and creating Bangladeshis is not the same thing. A political revolution may result in the formation of a state, and perhaps even partially stabilise its foundations, but the fundamental question remains: who are we and what have we achieved in the intervening years? Independence only marks one stage in nationalist ideals. Simply condemning subjugation or celebrating its end is not enough to ensure advancement to the next phase. What must be done is to foster a sense of solidarity within the collective consciousness of the people within the state, and through that, transform the fragmented segments of the nation into a unified identity. The actions of the national government must then be determined in accordance with the demands of this unified identity. This is precisely what Ziaur Rahman did through his concept of Bangladeshi nationalism. Through this, Zia determined the relationship, significance, and inherent elements of two key sensibilities: the “local way of life” and the “spirit of the times.” Bangladeshis want to follow their own way of life while also keeping pace with the era. Zia was the embodiment of these dual sensibilities and in therein lies his greatness. There are numerous examples in his policies and actions as head of state that demonstrate how he harmonised indigenous lifestyles with the demands of the modern age. This means initiating the process of social transformation through the interaction between contemporary imperatives and social realities. Zia understood how to reconcile what Edward Shils called the “will to be modern” and what Mazzini referred to as the “need to exist and to have a name.” What could be a greater virtue for a statesman and nationalist leader? * Mahbub Ullah is an economist and political analyst* The views expressed here are the writer's own.",NA

We know it very well, there will be no more elections in this country ever again if the election is not held in December. Bangladesh will come under the influence of foreign masters,” he said, indicating the interim government. Mirza Abbas was addressing an event marking the 44th death anniversary of former president and BNP’s founder Ziaur Rahman in front of the party headquarters at Naya Paltan in Dhaka this afternoon. BNP’s ward no. 13 in Paltan Thana organised the event to distribute food among the poor and destitute. Chief adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus has pitted himself against BNP, Mirza Abbas remarked. “He sat in Japan and spoke with animosity against BNP. From Japan, he claimed that only BNP wants elections in December. In response, I want to say, Dr Yunus, please recall that it was you who first spoke about elections being held in December,” he added. Referring to a recent meeting between the BNP and the chief adviser, the BNP leader said, “After we left the meeting, around 6:00 or 6:30 in the evening, your press secretary said that elections could be held in June. But the press secretary and you are not the same.” Mirza Abbas also remarked that the interim government will never achieve the kind of reforms introduced by Ziaur Rahman during his rule. He said, “The reforms introduced by Ziaur Rahman can not be matched by this government even in a lifetime. Ziaur Rahman made numerous reforms in sectors such as health and education, yet he never made announcements about those.” Pointing out that the interim government is announcing reforms while bringing in people from abroad, the BNP standing committee member said, “Today, this reformist government is importing people from outside to carry out reforms - people who are not citizens of this country, who do not have the same love for the nation, who do not love the country. How could such people reform the lives of our citizens? We do not understand this.” Stating that the New Mooring Terminal at Chattogram port has operational capabilities, he questioned, “Then why hand over this terminal to foreigners? If the foreigners come, they won’t keep their money in Bangladesh. So, stop this love with foreigners; instead, care for your own people. We will train our own citizens. Local people will run the New Mooring Terminal. We do not need outsiders.” Posing a question to the government, Mirza Abbas said, “There is no food, no clothes, people cannot even send their children to school in Saint Martin’s Island. What has happened in Saint Martin’s island that Bangladeshi boats can no longer go there? What exactly is happening there? We want to know. We also want to know what is going on in Sajek.” The event was also attended by BNP central committee’s assistant youth affairs secretary Mir Nawaz Ali and Dhaka South city BNP member secretary Tanvir Ahmed Robin. The programme was hosted by former general secretary of Paltan thana BNP, Kazi Hasibur Rahman Shakil.",NA

Two vessels, Mermaid-3 and Navimar-3, crashed into the shore at Anwara. Mermaid-3 is a barge while Navimar-3 is a tugboat. The two vessels were anchored within the maritime boundary of Chittagong Port as there are five undisposed lawsuits over the two vessels. Large stones were brought from India by the barge for the construction of the SS Power Plant in Banshkhali, Chattogram nearly two years ago. At that time, although the Navimar-3 tugboat supplied fuel, its owners were not paid any bills. Similarly, the local representative of the two vessels, Vision Shipping Company, also did not receive any payment. When asked, an official from Vision Shipping Company told Prothom Alo, “The owners of the vessel are not responding. Even though we have not received any payment, we have been continuously providing four guards for the two vessels regularly.” One of the guards, Miskatur Rahman, said, “The vessels lost control due to strong waves at sea and crashed into the shore.” Meanwhile, two more ships became stranded on the Patenga coast of Chattogram due to stormy weather on Thursday night. Those two ships are - M. V. Al Herem and BLPG Sophia. The BLPG Sophia had previously been damaged by an explosion and fire while transferring LPG gas in October.",NA

https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/politics/rejvrda8ob,What is in NCP's framework for poll-time govt?,https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/politics/rejvrda8ob,"The National Citizen Party (NCP) proposed a framework for an election-time interim or caretaker government, as well as the appointment of the chief adviser of such a government through parliament. NCP emailed its proposals to the National Consensus Commission on 25 May. According to NCP sources, the proposal will be formally handed over once the commission begins the second round of discussions with political parties, which is scheduled to begin in the first week of June. The Constitution Reform Commission also recommended incorporating a provision for an ‘interim government’ in the constitution, as well as proposed a framework for such a government. During the Consensus Commission’s first phase of discussions with political parties, almost all political parties agreed to the matter of an election-time interim or caretaker government. But, no consensus has yet been reached on the framework of such a government. The Constitution Reform Commission said in its proposal that the interim government would be formed after the tenure of parliament ends or if parliament is dissolved, and would remain in power until the next elected government is sworn in. According to the commission, the maximum duration of interim government would be 90 days. The advisory council would consist of a maximum of 15 members, including the chief adviser. The chief adviser would be appointed by a National Constitutional Council (NCC) formed by the executive, judiciary, and legislature. A minimum of seven out of nine members of the NCC must reach a consensus to appoint any individual as the chief adviser. If the chief adviser cannot be appointed through this process, the Constitution Reform Commission also proposed six more ways to appoint the chief adviser.  The other advisers in the advisory council will be nominated by the chief adviser. According to the NCP, the election-time government can be called ‘election-time interim government’ or ‘election-time caretaker government’. They proposed forming an 11-member all-party committee at least three weeks before the dissolution of the lower house of parliament. The number of members from each parliamentary party in the committee would be determined based on proportional representation from the votes received. Any party having votes over 5 per cent is eligible to include members in the parliamentary committee, it said. Members of both upper and lower houses will be eligible to be members of the committee. The ruling party, the main opposition, and other opposition parties would each propose the names of three non-partisan individuals, totalling nine names for the chief adviser of the election-time interim/caretaker government. NCP further said the proposed names must be made public. The proposed names would be sent to an all-party parliamentary committee, and the committee would finalise a name of the chief adviser with an 8-3 majority vote. If no candidate among the proposed names is finalised through this process, the upper house will elect the chief adviser based on ranked-choice voting. The NCP also highlights some disqualifications for becoming chief adviser. These include: anyone convicted of corruption or any criminal offense, anyone with credible and acceptable evidence of moral turpitude, anyone holding currently or formerly holding membership of a political party or its affiliated or shadow organisations, and anyone making political remarks in the past. Speaking about this, NCP joint convener Sarwar Tushar told Prothom Alo that outlining the framework for a peaceful and uninterrupted power transition process is crucial in this reform agenda. In the past, political parties came to office through election and then showed a tendency to cling to power in an undemocratic manner. A permanent solution for peaceful power transition must be found to prevent such ulterior motives. The NCP recommended appointing the election-time chief adviser through an all-party parliamentary committee. As a result, the formation of caretaker governments with the individuals loyal to the ruling party will stop, as well as the path to hold free and fair elections will be smoother.",NA

In a statement issued to the media on Thursday, the alliance urged all to be united so that nobody can hinder the country’s renewed journey through any divisive efforts. The statement noted, “In 1971, the course of Bangladesh’s history moved in one direction, while Jamaat took the opposite. The people stood on one side, Jamaat on the other, and it is a proven fact. If they want to offer an apology to the people for their past stance, it must come with no ifs and buts. We do not believe that any ambiguity or ifs and buts will gain public acceptance.” Expressing concern over efforts to create division, Gonotontro Moncho said ongoing efforts to play the game of division, launch attacks, and put new labels raise fresh fears of whether a new form of fascism is emerging, similar to the Awami League. All should pay attention to prevent such threats. The alliance firmly rejected recent efforts by various quarters to pit 1971 and 2024 against each other. It said the aspirations of the people in the 1971 liberation war were betrayed when the fascism was established and the people’s rights were undermined. “The mass uprising of 2024 is a continuation of the spirit of 1971, and there is no contradiction against each other.” Gonotontro Moncho was formed on 8 August 2022, with seven parties.

The BNP standing committee member remarked that former president Ziaur Rahman is a reflection of the history of Bangladesh. “Ziaur Rahman was born for the independence of this country. He embraced martyrdom protecting the independence of this country. He introduced multiparty democracy in the country and formed the judicial council for the independence of the judiciary,” Salahuddin Ahmed stated. The BNP leader further said Ziaur Rahman was brutally killed to suppress democracy and development of this country. “We shall establish the foundation of democracy and constitutional framework of this country and transform this country into a social justice-based nondiscriminatory one,” he added.",NA

He said they were striving to ensure justice, equality, independence and dignity for the people and to fulfill their dreams and aspirations. He was speaking yesterday, Thursday, at 30th Nikkei Forum inaugural session, 'Future of Asia' held at the Imperial Hotel in the Japanese capital Tokyo. He later spoke at the question and answer session of the forum. His deliberations at the question and answer session were later broadcast over the state television BTV. In reply to a question, the chief advisor said, the interim government is working with three objectives. One is reforms, the second is the trial of those who committed crimes (during the July mass uprising) and the third is elections. Professor Yunus said that they had told the people that the election will be held in December this year or, at the latest, in June next year. However, he said, many politicians were questioning why not in December? ""Not all political parties, he added, ""one particular..."" Saying that when the election would be held depended entirely on how far the reforms are being carried out, the chief advisor stated, ""If we want to leave the country as before, leave the institutions as they were before, then we can talk about elections in December. If we hurry things up, just do a few reforms and wait for the other reforms, they we can do this (the election) in December. But if we need good reforms, then we have to wait for another six months."" However, he pointed out, there were those who wanted to get done with the election putting the reforms to one side. He added that not all political parties were saying this, just one. The chief advisor reiterated that they had no political ambitions. He will hand over power to a political government through an election. The chief advisor made these remarks at a time when Bangladesh's political arena was heated up over the date of the upcoming national parliamentary election. BNP has taken up a firm stance for the election to be held by December. Last Wednesday, during a BNP rally in Dhaka, the party’s acting chairman Tarique Rahman joined virtually and said that the election must be held by December. At the opening session of the Nikkei Forum ""Future of Asia,"" Professor Yunus mentioned the recent changes at the helm in Bangladesh. He said that last year, a change took place in the country through a mass uprising led by students, and afterward, his government assumed responsibility. The chief advisor said, “We are working to fulfill the dreams and aspirations of our people, to ensure justice, equality, freedom, and the dignity of the people, and to achieve a peaceful transition to democracy through the conduct of a free, fair, and credible general election.” He said, “We believe this is an opportunity to correct our mistakes, to build new institutions, and to turn the dream of a just society into reality.”Noting that Bangladesh continues to play its role despite facing multifarious internal challenges, Professor Muhammad Yunus said that Bangladesh is contributing to global peace and security by participating in UN peacekeeping and peace-building missions, and by sheltering one million Rohingyas who fled from Myanmar for humanitarian reasons.He said that Asia, home to more than half of the world’s population, stands at the center of uncertainty, and also at the center of possibilities. In his speech, ""Asia’s Challenge in a Turbulent World,"" Professor Muhammad Yunus said that the world is going through a period of extreme uncertainty. Global trust is under threat.

https://en.prothomalo.com/sports/cricket/wgaclxrfk1,No confidence in Faruque: They too can be accused of ‘copy-paste’ allegations,https://en.prothomalo.com/sports/cricket/wgaclxrfk1,"Eight directors of the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) submitted a no-confidence letter to the sports adviser, bringing multiple charges against board president Faruque Ahmed. Within hours, and without giving him a chance to defend himself, the National Sports Council (NSC) cancelled its nomination for Faruque as a BCB director.  The letter, the subsequently disclosed investigation report of the Bangladesh Premier League (BPL), and the removal order — all appeared to be the part of a pre-written script.  On the night before these developments, Faruque was told by the sports adviser that the “higher authority” no longer wants him to continue as the BCB president. When Faruque asked for a reason, none was given. Later, he informed the media yesterday that he would not resign unless he received a proper explanation. Within hours, the no-confidence letter signed by eight BCB directors spread on media and social media platforms. Almost simultaneously, the BPL investigation report — which blamed Faruque solely despite multiple parties being involved — was published. Later, the NSC revoked its nomination to Faruque as a BCB director. It seems all the guns were already aimed. If Faruque had quietly stepped down, this chain reaction may not have taken place. But he chose to stay, inviting the attacks one after another. In the onesided-game, he was removed, without getting a chance to defend himself. As an NSC-nominated director, it would have been proper protocol for the NSC to talk to Faruque first if they had concerns. But it did not happen, thanks to an invisible control over the developments. Faruque has rejected the allegations mentioned in the no-confidence letter, calling them “copy-paste” allegations. It means he is being accused of the same wrongdoings allegedly committed over the past 12 years by the very directors who signed the letter. If so, such a no-confidence motion can be brought against the directors as well! Let’s take a closer look at the claims made in the no-confidence letter. Those who know Faruque Ahmed describe him as a man of strong personality and clear words. In professional spaces, he sometimes behaves strictly. This strict nature might be the basis for the allegation of being arbitrary and authoritarian. But is Faruque more ‘arbitrary and authoritarian’ than Nazmul Hassan was during his tenure as BCB president under the Awami League regime? Arbitrary, authoritarian – these were more suitable with Nazmul Hassan. Even the directors who signed this no-confidence letter used to talk about Nazmul’s authoritative behaviour and suppression of dissent on different occasions. Yet, they never filed a no-confidence motion against him. Rather, they extended consent to each and every decision made by him. Corruption and irregularities were widespread during the previous board, with lower-level cricket hit hard by match-fixing and umpiring bias. Did any of these directors raise their voices then? No. During the tenure of Nazmul Hassan, two signatories of the no-confidence letter were directly in charge of CCDM, which is familiar due to the underhand politics of club cricket. Under their leadership, did the CCDM take any effective action against match fixing and biased umpiring? In contrast, their clubs, and those of some other influential signatories of the no-confidence letter, took advantage of the practice. In 2018, former BCB director Ismail Haider Mallick admitted in an interview that all 56 clubs of domestic cricket were under the same umbrella, and used to take advantage of match-fixing and biased umpiring. Some of the no-confidence letter signatories were linked to those clubs, and they took benefits from the widespread corruption in domestic cricket. None of them refuted Mallick’s statement. They indulged in unjust activities, in the interest of their own clubs. Even the person who served as the head of the umpires committee during the peak of biased umpiring is also among the signatories of the no-confidence letter. The letter accused Faruque of taking as long as five months to restructure BCB committees and of making decisions unilaterally while preventing others from performing properly. But do the directors know that Faruque Ahmed has direction from higher authorities to limit activities of some directors, as they were allies of the ‘fascists’ in the previous board. This is why, in the initial days, he ran the board with only one or two directors. Some of the directors who signed the letter had close ties with the previous regime, and benefitted from them. One was even the convener of the Sheikh Hasina International Stadium project committee. Faruque scrapped the project due to its excessive cost. Initially budgeted at Tk 9 billion, the project’s estimated cost ballooned to Tk 15 billion even before construction began. A suspicious Tk 760 million consultancy contract was signed with an Australian company. The Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) is currently investigating the matter. The convener of the stadium project also got the tender of installing floodlights at the national stadium (current name), due to his close ties with former BCB president and sports minister Nazmul Hasan. From the beginning, Faruque was instructed to keep some directors, including the stadium committee convener, to keep away from board operations. For the same reason, many officials and employees recruited by the previous board were kept inactive. All these inevitably slowed down the board’s activities and forced the BCB president to make many decisions independently. Now, the NSC has revoked Faruque Ahmed’s nomination, due to the no-confidence letter filed by the controversial directors. Faruque Ahmed removed former head coach Chandika Hathurusingha on his own decision. It’s true that Faruque had personal issues with the Sri Lankan coach — he had stepped down from the selection panel earlier due to interference by Hathurusingha and the BCB president. But at the time of Hathurusingha’s removal, did any of the board directors protest? In fact, some of them criticised the coach strongly in talk-shows and newspaper columns. The other directors castigated him in the board meeting. A former national cricketer, who became influential in the present context, also took a position against the coach. By raising the issue now in the letter, these directors have only reminded the public that Faruque once gave up the post of chief selector protesting undue interference by board president Nazmul Hassan in 2016 — something none of them dared to do. Despite being on the same board, they did not even protest against any unjust. The no-confidence letter, in another way, acknowledges that Bangladesh cricket was better during the tenure of former BCB president Nazmul Hassan. Why? Because the signatories themselves wrote that during the past years (under the Awami League regime), the Bangladesh team played exceptionally well and rose to sixth or seventh in the ICC rankings. Now, they claim the national team’s performance is on the downward trend due to Faruque’s “arbitrary conduct and undue interference in the cricket operations department,” which they allege has pushed Bangladesh to 10th in the rankings. It's hard to fathom that such a bizarre and unsuitable argument was supported by someone considered an experienced figure in the country's cricket — the very person who now heads the BCB’s cricket operations department. When a national team underperforms, responsibility should first go to the coach and players — but right after them, it should fall on the operations chief. If his department has truly been subjected to “undue interference” by the president, has he ever protested that? Is it fair for him to claim that it's the BCB president alone who’s responsible for the team’s poor performance? It’s not just Bangladesh — global cricket media are aware of interference by former president Nazmul Hassan in team affairs. Despite being a former cricketer, Faruque Ahmed, by contrast, has barely involved himself in national team matters. Anyone speaking to national team players would know this. Yet, those who once supported Nazmul in his excessive interference in the team are now making funny allegations against Faruque Ahmed. The no-confidence letter noted that the main intention behind Faruque Ahmed’s appointment was to amend the board’s constitution and to prepare a white paper documenting the corruption and irregularities that occurred during the previous government’s term. Faruque Ahmed was on the due course, but it was the very directors who signed the no-confidence letter that did not let him advance. In a board meeting chaired by Faruque, Nazmul Abedin was entrusted with the responsibility for drafting the amendment. He did prepare a draft for a time-befitting constitution. But everyone knows why the draft is not being approved, and that is club politics. As the draft recommended a reduction in the power of clubs within the BCB, the clubs in Dhaka demanded Nazmul Abedin’s resignation. Ironically, some of those club leaders are the same people who signed the no-confidence motion and are now questioning why Faruque failed to deliver an amended constitution. The Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) has already begun investigating the corruption and irregularities of the previous BCB board. As president, Faruque Ahmed instructed all relevant officials to fully cooperate with ACC investigators, and this cooperation has continued. ACC officials have visited the BCB office three times to collect documents and data. There has been no claim or complaint from the ACC that Faruque hindered their work in any way. However, sources said a board director — who was also on the previous board and is now a signatory of the no-confidence letter — unnecessarily roams around the ACC team during their visits and even sits beside them on occasion. Learning about the issue, Faruque Ahmed advised him not to stay there so that the ACC can carry out its work independently and without undue influence. The no-confidence letter also placed the blame for all BPL-related irregularities solely on Faruque Ahmed, when the responsibility also falls on other members, including the member secretary of the BPL governing council. The letter alleged that Faruque bypassed BCB’s listed vendors to favor a low-quality, unregistered event management company of his choosing. But what was the real motive behind this allegation? This deserves careful scrutiny. Most of the companies currently listed as BCB vendors were registered under the previous board. Are the eight directors confirmed that those vendors were listed in full compliance with rules? Can they confirm that the previous board always followed proper procedures when awarding contracts? If there are issues with the new company that Faruque favoured, they could have named it clearly in the letter. Doing so might even make the ACC’s job easier! Faruque Ahmed may have flaws as BCB president. He may have committed errors, or even shown favouritism. But should he be removed immediately, just because someone has made allegations? Such accusations should first be investigated. Faruque must be allowed the opportunity to defend himself. When none of the formalities are followed, and yet his nomination as a BCB director is suddenly revoked, it becomes obvious that the “copy-paste” allegations were just part of a pre-written script. The real question is — who wrote that script?",NA

Over 5,000 Base Transceiver Station (BTS), commonly known as mobile towers, have shut down due to the power outage. Special adviser to the chief adviser on posts, telecommunication and information technology Faiz Ahmad Taiyeb shared this information in a post published on his Facebook page around 10:00 am today, Friday. A deep depression formed in the Bay of Bengal on Thursday, resulting in heavy rainfall across large parts of the country, including the capital. The deep depression has now weakened into a land depression and is expected to convert into a low-pressure today. That means it will significantly lose its strength by the end of the day. However, rain is likely to continue throughout the day and into tomorrow, Saturday in various parts of the country in the impact. According to the meteorological department, five divisions are likely to experience heavy to very heavy rainfall today due to the low pressure. In his Facebook post, Faiz Ahmad Taiyeb stated that telecommunication services are being disrupted across the country from the storm and tidal wave caused by the depression and the impact of the natural disaster on the power distribution system. He also mentioned that the telecommunication workers including the rural electrification board are working tirelessly to restore the network. Faiz Ahmad Taiyeb noted in the post that Barisal, Sylhet south, Tangail, Chandpur, Mymensingh, Dhaka north, Cumilla, Noakhali, and Chattogram south are the regions that have been impacted severely.",NA

https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/local-news/824ekvaemw,Kuakata's 'Marine Drive' collapses before opening,https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/local-news/824ekvaemw,"A newly built road in Kuakata, modeled after the Marine Drive, has partially collapsed due to tidal surges just before its scheduled inauguration. The two-kilometre stretch, costing around Tk 48.6 million (Tk 4.86 crore), began to cave in at around 10:00 am on Wednesday due to the high tides. Multiple sections between Zero Point and the eastern end of the road caved in, submerging several nearby establishments, including a police box, Sardar Market and a street food hub known as Fuchka Market. Tourist police and local volunteers evacuated tourists to safer areas using loudspeakers. Locals blame poor construction quality and lack of oversight for the damage. “Low-grade materials were used, and there was no proper supervision during the work,” one resident alleged. Concerns are rising that without immediate intervention, the entire project might be lost. Local resident Abul Bashar warned, “The monsoon is approaching, and the sea will only become more ferocious. The damage could escalate if nothing is done soon.” The road was part of a Kuakata Municipality project initiated in 2024 to boost tourism and protect the scenic coastline. Despite the high budget, complaints regarding construction quality have surfaced from the beginning. Despite repeated attempts over mobile phone Kuakata Municipality Administrator Yaseen Sadee could not be reached. Meanwhile, the Bangladesh Meteorological Department had earlier warned of tidal surges of 2 to 4 feet due to a deep depression crossing the Bay of Bengal. Four coastal districts, including Patuakhali, were placed under local alert level three. Assistant Superintendent of Tourist Police Habibur Rahman said, “We’re relocating people to prevent accidents during this adverse weather.” Upazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO) Md. Robiul Islam said after the appointment of the administrator in the municipality, the remaining bill for the road has not been paid. Compensation will be realised for the damage and necessary measures will be taken, he said. Moreover, embankments in 11 points across four upazilas in Patuakhali have broken, flooding low-lying areas and affecting over 20,000 people. More than 100 fish farms have also been inundated, causing heavy losses.",NA

https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/tubpzwcvri,The Ganatantrik Odhikar Committee has raised the question of how a known war criminal could be declared innocent.,https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/tubpzwcvri,"The Ganatantrik Odhikar Committee has raised the question of how a known war criminal could be declared innocent. It stated that the way the Awami League government initiated a flawed war crimes trial process to serve its narrow party interests, the interim government is now protecting Jamaat’s interests in the same spirit. The Ganatantrik Odhikar Committee said this in a statement issued today, Friday, in response to the acquittal of former acting secretary general of Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, ATM Azharul Islam, from his death sentence in the case filed on charges of committing crimes against humanity in 1971. The statement was issued on behalf of committee members including Professor Anu Muhammad, Haroon Ur Rashid, Seema Dutta, Samina Luthfa, Abdullah Al Kafi, Fakhruddin Kabir Atik, Maha Mirza, Afzal Hossain, and Marzia Prova. “In an Appellate Division review hearing, ATM Azhar, a known war criminal and Jamaat leader sentenced to death by the International Crimes Tribunal, was declared innocent and acquitted of all charges unconditionally. The adviser to the law ministry dubbed this verdict as just. We want to say that exonerating a known war criminal by declaring him completely innocent is not justice; rather this serves as an example of political influence over the judiciary,” the statement said. Mentioning that ATM Azhar was Islami Chhatra Sangha’s Rangpur district committee chief and the leader of the Al-Badr force during the liberation war in 1971, the Ganatantrik Odhikar Committee said Azhar, along with Jamaat, Al-Badr, and Islami Chhatra Sangha, stood with Pakistan in the war and was involved in genocide, rape, and crimes against humanity. The historical evidence of Jamaat’s role in the genocide shows that Azhar, due to his organisational position, was a complicit. However, from the start, the International Crimes Tribunal did not follow the fundamental principles of trying genocide, choosing instead to prosecute individuals rather than the organisations like Jamaat, Al-Badr, Al-Shams, and Chhatra Shibir. Claiming that global standards for prosecuting genocide were not followed, the committee added, “What is surprising is that although the interim government admitted the flaws in the tribunal’s proceedings, it still pursued an appeal review within the same flawed process. We assert that just as the Awami League government launched this flawed trial process to serve its narrow political interests, the interim government is now continuing that legacy by preserving Jamaat’s interests.” The statement further claimed that the interim government structured the ICT in such a way that several prosecutors, including the chief prosecutor, had previously served as defence lawyers for war crimes accused. This created a conflict of interest that influenced the verdict. Additionally, the current state lawyers refused to take responsibility for the previous prosecution’s failures, which not only constituted professional misconduct but also weakened the entire judicial process. The current prosecution had a duty to correct past mistakes and defend the state. In such a circumstance, declaring the accused innocent and acquitting him unconditionally of charges is a mockery in the name of justice. The committee remarked that the July mass uprising had generated hopes for democracy, justice, and an independent judiciary, but the acquittal of Jamaat leader Azhar goes against those hopes and effectively ensures that the July massacre will not be prosecuted. Referring to the brutal attack by Islami Chhatra Shibir, Jamaat’s student wing, on students protesting the verdict under the banner of the Ganatantrik Chhatra Jote (Democratic Students Alliance), the committee noted that several students were seriously injured. They also said Shibir is now repeating the pattern of attacks that the Bangladesh Chhatra League carried out against student protests over the past 15 years. Female students were specifically targeted, and in Sylhet, a female student was repeatedly threatened by Shibir members for speaking out. This pattern of behaviour proves Chhatra Shibir, raised under the patronage of the Chhatra League for 15 years, is now carrying the same fascist ideology and behaviour of the Awami League, it added. The Ganatantrik Odhikar Committee demanded an immediate correction and restructuring of the flawed International Crimes Tribunal complying with the fundamental principles of genocide prosecution, to enable trials of both Jamaat and Awami League for their roles in the genocide. It also called for the identification and prosecution of Chhatra Shibir members involved in attacks on peaceful demonstrations.",NA
https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/politics/876tq9cx1o,"Gono Forum leaders said, to reap the benefits of the mass uprising, it was essential to establish democracy, the rule of law, and voting rights",https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/politics/876tq9cx1o,"Gono Forum has said the statement made by the chief advisor of the interim government Professor Muhammad Yunus during his Japan visit that no party other than one wants the elections in December, is not true. It said that Gono Forum has been demanding that reforms necessary for free, fair and credible elections  be carried out so the election could be held in December. Gono Forum's presidium council meeting was held in the afternoon today, Friday, at the party's central office. Presidium council member SM Altaf Hossain chaired the meeting which was also attended by the party's general secretary Md Mizanur Rahman, presidium council members Subrata Chowdhury, Jaglul Haider Afrik, Mesbahuddin, Mustaq Ahmed, Suraiya Begum, Selim Akbar, Shah Nuruzzaman and others. A press release of Gono Forum, outlining the issues discussed in the meeting, stated that the statements made by the chief advisor and other advisors regarding the election appeared vague and confusing. This was creating a division among active political parties. Gono Forum leaders said that to reap the benefits of the mass uprising, it is essential to establish democracy, the rule of law, and voting rights in the country. The government has failed to adopt a clear framework for the necessary reforms or implement any concrete plans to this end. It is unfortunate that the blame for this failure is being shifted onto political parties. The party also noted that recent discussions about the resignation of the chief advisor and meetings between the government and certain political parties have further disheartened the nation. Gono Forum stated that the government’s decision not to invite them to the latest meeting between the chief adviser and political parties indicates an attempt to create divisions among active political forces. Gono Forum leaders further stated that in the past nine months, the government had failed to take effective steps to restore law and order and resolve instability in public administration. Additionally, no necessary reforms or visible efforts had been made to ensure free, fair, and credible elections. As a result, public support for the government was declining, while distrust was growing both among political parties and in the public mind. At the meeting of the Gono Forum presidium council, a demand was made for the immediate announcement of a concrete election roadmap. It also called on all to remain vigilant so that the national unity forged through the mass uprising in July to establish democracy and good governance in the country was not destroyed by any evil forces.",NA
https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/politics/kfwreflpmf,"The mass uprising of 2024 is a continuation of the spirit of 1971, and there is no contradiction against each other, the alliance of six",https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/politics/kfwreflpmf,"Gonotontro Moncho, an alliance of six political parties, has emphasised the need for national unity among the people to ensure a democratic transition in Bangladesh. In a statement issued to the media on Thursday, the alliance urged all to be united so that nobody can hinder the country’s renewed journey through any divisive efforts. The statement noted, “In 1971, the course of Bangladesh’s history moved in one direction, while Jamaat took the opposite. The people stood on one side, Jamaat on the other, and it is a proven fact. If they want to offer an apology to the people for their past stance, it must come with no ifs and buts. We do not believe that any ambiguity or ifs and buts will gain public acceptance.” Expressing concern over efforts to create division, Gonotontro Moncho said ongoing efforts to play the game of division, launch attacks, and put new labels raise fresh fears of whether a new form of fascism is emerging, similar to the Awami League. All should pay attention to prevent such threats. The alliance firmly rejected recent efforts by various quarters to pit 1971 and 2024 against each other. It said the aspirations of the people in the 1971 liberation war were betrayed when the fascism was established and the people’s rights were undermined. “The mass uprising of 2024 is a continuation of the spirit of 1971, and there is no contradiction against each other.” Gonotontro Moncho was formed on 8 August 2022, with seven parties. It is currently an alliance of six political parties after one withdrew. The existing parties are the Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal (JSD) led by ASM Abdur Rob, Nagorik Oikya led by Mahmudur Rahman Manna, the Revolutionary Workers Party of Bangladesh led by Saiful Haque, Ganosamhati Andolon led by Zonayed Saki, Bhasani Janashakti Party led by Rafiqul Islam, and Rastro Songskar Andolan led by Hasnat Kaiyum.",NA

We also have expressed our expectations aligning with the aspirations of the nation,” he said. Salahuddin Ahmed said this after distributing food among the poor and destitutes at the High Court Mazar Gate marking the 44th death anniversary of former president and BNP’s founder Ziaur Rahman. Earlier in the day, he distributed clothes among the poor and destitute people at Manik Mia Avenue. The BNP standing committee member remarked that former president Ziaur Rahman is a reflection of the history of Bangladesh. “Ziaur Rahman was born for the independence of this country. He embraced martyrdom protecting the independence of this country. He introduced multiparty democracy in the country and formed the judicial council for the independence of the judiciary,” Salahuddin Ahmed stated. The BNP leader further said Ziaur Rahman was brutally killed to suppress democracy and development of this country. “We shall establish the foundation of democracy and constitutional framework of this country and transform this country into a social justice-based nondiscriminatory one,” he added.",NA
https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/politics/8gad5kryme,"Chief advisor Professor Muhammad Yunus, at the Nikkei Forum in Tokyo, spoke of preparations for a free and fair election to transit to democracy.",https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/politics/8gad5kryme,"Chief advisor Professor Muhammad Yunus has said that the interim government is preparing for a free, fair and credible election for a transition to democracy. He said they were striving to ensure justice, equality, independence and dignity for the people and to fulfill their dreams and aspirations. He was speaking yesterday, Thursday, at 30th Nikkei Forum inaugural session, 'Future of Asia' held at the Imperial Hotel in the Japanese capital Tokyo. He later spoke at the question and answer session of the forum. His deliberations at the question and answer session were later broadcast over the state television BTV. In reply to a question, the chief advisor said, the interim government is working with three objectives. One is reforms, the second is the trial of those who committed crimes (during the July mass uprising) and the third is elections. Professor Yunus said that they had told the people that the election will be held in December this year or, at the latest, in June next year. However, he said, many politicians were questioning why not in December? ""Not all political parties, he added, ""one particular..."" Saying that when the election would be held depended entirely on how far the reforms are being carried out, the chief advisor stated, ""If we want to leave the country as before, leave the institutions as they were before, then we can talk about elections in December. If we hurry things up, just do a few reforms and wait for the other reforms, they we can do this (the election) in December. But if we need good reforms, then we have to wait for another six months."" However, he pointed out, there were those who wanted to get done with the election putting the reforms to one side. He added that not all political parties were saying this, just one. The chief advisor reiterated that they had no political ambitions. He will hand over power to a political government through an election. The chief advisor made these remarks at a time when Bangladesh's political arena was heated up over the date of the upcoming national parliamentary election. BNP has taken up a firm stance for the election to be held by December. Last Wednesday, during a BNP rally in Dhaka, the party’s acting chairman Tarique Rahman joined virtually and said that the election must be held by December. At the opening session of the Nikkei Forum ""Future of Asia,"" Professor Yunus mentioned the recent changes at the helm in Bangladesh. He said that last year, a change took place in the country through a mass uprising led by students, and afterward, his government assumed responsibility. The chief advisor said, “We are working to fulfill the dreams and aspirations of our people, to ensure justice, equality, freedom, and the dignity of the people, and to achieve a peaceful transition to democracy through the conduct of a free, fair, and credible general election.” He said, “We believe this is an opportunity to correct our mistakes, to build new institutions, and to turn the dream of a just society into reality.”Noting that Bangladesh continues to play its role despite facing multifarious internal challenges, Professor Muhammad Yunus said that Bangladesh is contributing to global peace and security by participating in UN peacekeeping and peace-building missions, and by sheltering one million Rohingyas who fled from Myanmar for humanitarian reasons.He said that Asia, home to more than half of the world’s population, stands at the center of uncertainty, and also at the center of possibilities. In his speech, ""Asia’s Challenge in a Turbulent World,"" Professor Muhammad Yunus said that the world is going through a period of extreme uncertainty. Global trust is under threat. Noting that the world is becoming increasingly unstable, he said that trust is eroding among nations, within societies, and even between citizens and institutions.Professor Yunus further said, “We are going through a deeply uncertain time. We are witnessing a world where peace is being disrupted, tensions are rising, and mutual cooperation can no longer be taken for granted.” The chief advisor said, “Recently, a short but costly war broke out between our two neighbors. It is deeply unfortunate that while we are spending billions on war, millions of people are struggling with hunger or to meet their most basic needs.” He thanked the leaders of both countries for agreeing to a ceasefire. The chief advisor also said, “What we need is a new kind of economy, one that is built not on competition but on compassion. Not one driven solely by consumption, but by the well-being of others. That is where our future lies.”",NA
