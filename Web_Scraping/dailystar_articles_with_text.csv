They made the commitment during an official bilateral meeting between two leaders at the office of the Japanese prime minister in Tokyo, according to a statement issued by the chief adviser's press wing. Japanese PM Ishiba described Bangladesh as a long-standing friend and said that Japan would stand by Bangladesh in its endeavour for a democratic transition. Shigeru Ishiba also commended Yunus, saying that Bangladesh will usher in a new era under his leadership. He also highlighted Bangladesh's importance for ensuring peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region. ""Bangladesh plays a critical role in regional stability ,"" the PM said. He said the two countries would conclude an Economic Partnership Agreement by the end of this year in an effort to boost trade and investment between the two nations. The CA thanked Ishiba for Japan's unwavering support of Bangladesh ""in the last ten months after the previous regime left a shattered economy, an empty coffer and destroyed institutions"". ""We thank Japan for supporting the interim government and its reform initiatives. We seek Japan's active support and cooperation in our endeavour,"" he said. Yunus reiterated Bangladesh's firm commitment to a vision of a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific for the shared prosperity of all. ""Bangladesh is ready to forge partnership and cooperation with Japan to ensure maritime safety and security, freedom of navigation, sustainable use and management of marine resources, promote enhanced connectivity, and combat transnational organised crimes in the Indo-Pacific,"" the chief adviser said. Yunus sought Japanese support for the construction of a land-based LNG terminal at Matarbari, an import-based LPG terminal at Moheshkhali and duty-free and quota-free access of Bangladeshi products to Japan for at least three years after the LDC graduation of Bangladesh in 2026. The CA also sought a Japanese soft loan for the improvement of the Dhaka-Chattagram National Highway into a six-lane access-controlled expressway, the upgradation of the Chattagram-Cox's Bazar highway, and the construction of a new four-lane bridge over the Meghna-Gomti river. He requested the PM to encourage Japanese manufacturers to invest in automobiles and electric vehicles, light machinery, high-tech electronics and the solar industry in Bangladesh and to connect its industrial value chain with Japan. The CA urged Tokyo to launch the ""Bangladesh-Japan Skilled Workforce Partnership"" programme in an effort to meet Japanese labour shortages and pave the way for the recruitment of hundreds of thousands of Bangladeshi workers in Japan. Yunus also asked Japan to increase the number of scholarships for Bangladeshi students and for technical and vocational education training instructors to study in Japan. The Japanese PM said Tokyo would provide assistance to Bangladesh to help overcome its challenges and the interim government's efforts to create a prosperous and democratic ""New Bangladesh"". The two leaders also discussed geopolitical issues in the region, with Yunus saying his government is committed to ""the best relationships"" with Dhaka's neighbours. The CA called for redoubling Japanese efforts for a durable solution to the Rohingya crisis. Ishiba recalled his visit to Bangladesh some 38 years ago when the Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge, built with Japanese assistance, was inaugurated. He also praised Yunus' efforts and his pioneering micro-lender, Grameen Bank, to combat poverty across the globe. ""Japanese people have profound respect for you,"" Ishiba noted. He expressed his willingness to visit Bangladesh at a mutually convenient time. শুক্রবার বিকালে বিসিবির পরিচালনা পর্ষদের সভায় নতুন সভাপতি নির্বাচিত হন আমিনুল ইসলাম বুলবুল",2025-05-30T21:29:56+06:00
https://www.thedailystar.net/opinion/views/the-third-view/news/nation-we-are-not-focused-education-3906796,"As a nation, we are not focused on education",https://www.thedailystar.net/opinion/views/the-third-view/news/nation-we-are-not-focused-education-3906796,"On May 22, this daily reported that National University Vice-Chancellor Prof ASM Amanullah had been attacked by a group of students demanding automatic pass in their degree (pass) examination held in 2022—three years ago. The NU had already permitted grace marks to this batch of students, whose studies had been affected by the COVID pandemic and political unrests in the country. Still, they could not procure the pass mark, so poor were their results. The students had also been given the opportunity to apply for the re-evaluation of their answer sheets. Despite these measures, according to an NU press release, a group of students decided to attack the VC so that he would concede to their demand out of fear. As of this writing, we did not hear of any stern action by the authorities against these students. Immediately following the July-August uprising, we saw a similar demand of ""auto pass"" by students in the vicinity of the secretariat. On May 16, we reported about the operational stalemate due to protests by students, and in one case by teachers, at four public universities, namely Dhaka University, Jagannath University, Khulna University of Engineering and Technology, and Barishal University. Disruptions in these universities brought classes, tutorials, and examinations to a halt, jeopardising the future of nearly 70,000 students. In these universities, almost all of the top echelons of administration were removed after the uprising last year. According to our earlier reports, VCs of 47 public universities who had been appointed during the reign of Sheikh Hasina either resigned or were forced to resign after the changeover of August 5. This included VCs of all our prestigious institutions, i.e. Dhaka University, Jahangirnagar University, Rajshahi University, Chittagong University, and Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology. Their successors were appointed from the other political spectrum. At least 30 VCs out of the 47 have links with pro-BNP or pro-Jamaat teachers' bodies. So what we saw was a change of guards and not of the practice. Why did the VCs of 47 public universities have to run away like our politicians? Were they so devoid of academic credentials and so intellectually bankrupt that they had no legitimacy of being appointed as heads of our highest seats of learning—other than sycophancy? The harsh truth is that most of the VC appointments at public universities—if not all—stemmed from political consideration, rather than academic. Sheikh Hasina politicised almost all institutions, but perhaps among the most damaging were the universities, especially the posts of VC. Once teachers saw that writing academic papers, doing original research, upholding academic standards, and creating an open academic environment where creative minds could flourish, did not pave the way for career success, things started to change. They saw clear and everyday evidence that toeing the political line was the surest way to getting foreign scholarships, higher positions, and, sadly, vice-chancellorships. It is then that our universities started crumbling. As the competition to seek favour got tougher—because sloganeering was always far easier that academic rigour—teachers started aligning themselves with student politics, whose support, in the last days of the Hasina regime, they needed to get elected to the Dhaka University Teachers' Association—which was a stepping stone for the VC post. This led to a deep moral bankruptcy. However, there were exceptions, too; we saw many teachers hold their head high, defy power, jeopardise their career, and uphold academic dignity.  When we talk about the success of countries like Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and most recently Vietnam and China, we mostly focus on their economic success. Never, if ever, do we talk about the contribution of their education systems that provided the crucial backbone to their economic strength. All these countries have spent a huge part of their resources in preparing their youth to face the future and succeed. In the latest and most advanced field of artificial intelligence, the world got surprised by a young Chinese scholar inventing the DeepSeek and upstaging the US. Did it happen by chance? Will it ever happen here? Of course it can. But for that, we have to set our priorities and invest in them. One can easily imagine the quality of the administration of VCs who came to occupy their chairs as a part of political rewards. This got reflected in recruitment, appointments, promotions, office holdings, and foreign travels. Research grants, which were always meagre, got awarded on the same lines. Thus, university teachers—again, not all of them—became a part of the culture of partisan politics that engulfed each and every institution in the country. The corruption of the academic world that followed dragged the quality of each of our famous universities to the bottom, which was epitomised by former DU VC Prof Md Akhtaruzzaman (2017-2023), whose famous comment that DU was the only university where ""you could buy a chop and somucha only for Tk 10."" It said it all about his notion of the academic standard of a university. We have focused only on the situation of our universities, controlling which should have been easy as student leadership is part of this government. The situation of other institutions is the same, if not worse. Here is a story from a well-regarded girls' school. Two girls were caught using their smartphones to copy answers from. When a teacher took away the phones and cancelled their answer sheets, a few of the students got together and started agitating and the school authorities decided to overlook the matter. It is the same in many institutions. Teachers come to class, utter the bare minimum, and leave immediately. The customary chatter and personal conversations between teachers and students have all but disappeared for fear as to who will interpret what and then upload on social media, taken mostly out of context. It is now nearly 10 months since students left their classes and took to the streets to remove a dictatorial government. That government has been replaced, but the students have not fully returned to their classes. Has anybody asked them to? No adviser, no political leader, and no student leader have told the students that what they have achieved is incomparable and the whole nation is grateful to them, but their future and that of the nation are tied to knowledge and our ability to use them in every aspect of our nation-building through innovation, enterprise, and energy. Where is that message? The chief adviser urged them to return to their classes back in September. For the changes we want to see, they must return to their studies. When we talk about the success of countries like Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and most recently Vietnam and China, we mostly focus on their economic success. Never, if ever, do we talk about the contribution of their education systems that provided the crucial backbone to their economic strength. All these countries have spent a huge part of their resources in preparing their youth to face the future and succeed. In the latest and most advanced field of artificial intelligence, the world got surprised by a young Chinese scholar inventing the DeepSeek and upstaging the US. Did it happen by chance? Will it ever happen here? Of course it can. But for that, we have to set our priorities and invest in them. It may sound like a fairytale that in the late 60s, South Korean business teams would visit East Pakistan to learn about textile and steel industries, especially from the Kobe steel complex that the Japanese had set up in Chattogram at that time. After 54 years of independence, where does our education stand today? We have had several education commissions, several revisions of our curricula, and spent billions, yet we have miserably failed to give the nation an education system that will prepare us for the future. Presently, we have had so many reform commissions, but none on education, reflecting our own sense of priority. In the 21st century world, there is no future without education—not of the old variety, but one that will lead us to the world of AI, quantum computers, blending of technology and all the sciences. A whole new world awaits us. Will we be a part of it or remain an onlooker? The changes can come not from rhetorics, but from real, concrete, and well-thought-out actions. We remain enamoured with slogans and confined to self-serving narratives. This will not open us up to the possibilities of the new world. Mahfuz Anam is the editor and publisher at The Daily Star.

However, no casualties were reported in the incidents. According to the district administration, 29 areas in Rangamati have been identified as vulnerable, and 26 shelters have been prepared to accommodate affected residents. Several families have already taken refuge, with authorities providing food assistance. The Rangamati Meteorological Office recorded 140.2mm of rainfall between 6:00am Thursday and 6:00am Friday. While, 48mm of rain was recorded between 6:00am and 6:00pm Friday, according to senior weather observer Kachhi Nu Marma. On Friday morning, a landslide was reported in Bhedbhedi Youth Development area, though no injuries were reported. Meanwhile, a Krishnachura tree collapsed in the Server Station area, temporarily blocking the Rangamati-Chattogram road. Fire Service and Civil Defence personnel swiftly cleared the debris, restoring traffic flow. Smaller landslides were also reported along the Rangamati-Chattogram highway, with road department teams working to remove the debris. Executive Engineer Sabuj Chakma of the Roads and Highways Department (RHD) Rangamati Division said while there were no major landslides, minor incidents have been promptly addressed. ""Our teams are actively working to ensure road safety,"" he said. Rangamati Deputy Commissioner Mohammad Habib Ullah assured that all necessary precautions have been taken to protect lives and property. ""Our top priority is ensuring that no lives are lost. We have already held meetings with disaster management committees across all ten upazilas and are fully prepared to respond accordingly."" শুক্রবার বিকালে বিসিবির পরিচালনা পর্ষদের সভায় নতুন সভাপতি নির্বাচিত হন আমিনুল ইসলাম বুলবুল",2025-05-30T22:16:27+06:00
https://www.thedailystar.net/opinion/editorial/news/save-sonadia-islands-mangrove-forests-3907236,Save Sonadia Island’s mangrove forests,https://www.thedailystar.net/opinion/editorial/news/save-sonadia-islands-mangrove-forests-3907236,"We are concerned about the relentless forest grabbing in Sonadia Island. During the AL regime, individuals connected to the government razed vast acres of forest on the island, and alarmingly, the destruction has continued even after the regime's fall. Since August 5, over 1,000 acres of protected mangrove forest have been reportedly cleared for shrimp and crab farming. This came to light after grabbers recently set fire to piles of felled trees to destroy evidence of their activities. Over the years, Sonadia's encroachers have cleared more than 3,000 acres of mangrove forest to establish shrimp enclosures. With the latest 1,000 acres encroached, the total now stands at 4,000. We wonder why the concerned authorities are unable to stop these illegal activities. In October last year, the High Court ordered relevant officials to remove illegal shrimp projects, take legal action against those destroying the mangroves, and submit a compliance report within 90 days. On November 28, the Supreme Court upheld this order, directing the government to stop mangrove destruction immediately. Yet forest grabbing, along with shrimp and crab farming, continues in this ecologically critical area. This is deeply unfortunate.  Last July, the Department of Environment (DoE) filed a case against 26 individuals, mostly linked to the AL, for seizing 128 acres of forest land in Sonadia, temporarily halting their action. But they soon resumed it in the absence of administrative follow-ups and legal consequences. Again, on May 18 this year, the DoE filed a case against 20 individuals, including a local BNP leader this time. This shows how the encroachment business has continued to enjoy political support regardless of the political transition, for which BNP and other parties must answer. While the relevant officials have sometimes taken actions, those have been mostly ineffective. For instance, last July, the Department of Environment (DoE) filed a case against 26 individuals, mostly linked to the AL, for seizing 128 acres of forest land, temporarily halting their action. But they soon resumed it in the absence of administrative follow-ups and legal consequences. Again, on May 18 this year, the DoE filed a case against 20 individuals, including a local BNP leader this time. This shows how the encroachment business has continued to enjoy political support regardless of the political transition, for which BNP and other parties must answer. We urge the authorities to make lawsuits against forest grabbers effective by ensuring swift case disposal and strict punishment. While the Sonadia administration has reportedly conducted some drives to stop the grabbers, these were insufficient. Such efforts must be increased. Moreover, the DoE must assess the actual scale of forest loss as the figures mentioned in official cases reportedly fall far short of reality. While the interim government's cancellation of land allocated to the Bangladesh Economic Zones Authority (BEZA) for establishing an eco-tourism park on the island is reassuring, it must now take comprehensive actions to stop the culture of forest grabbing. শুক্রবার বিকালে বিসিবির পরিচালনা পর্ষদের সভায় নতুন সভাপতি নির্বাচিত হন আমিনুল ইসলাম বুলবুল",2025-05-30T15:00:37+06:00
https://www.thedailystar.net/opinion/views/no-strings-attached/news/the-interim-governments-silence-over-misogyny-tragic-3906816,The interim government’s silence over misogyny is tragic,https://www.thedailystar.net/opinion/views/no-strings-attached/news/the-interim-governments-silence-over-misogyny-tragic-3906816,"To say we are like Alice hurtling down the rabbit hole with no clue where we are headed would be a euphemism. We are actually in freefall into an abyss with quiet acquiescence, taking the hits with silent resignation. There is chaos and dissent in every corner and no one seems to have a grip on anything. What has been most crushing and baffling is the silence of the interim government regarding the blatant misogyny publicly displayed—in rallies, mob violence, and online propaganda. Certain sections have decided that the current sense of freedom granted to them due to political expediency or fear—or both—has given them the licence to vent all their venom on women who dare to even speak of their rights as equal citizens. It's not like we didn't know about these groups. Over the past decade or so, we have seen how emboldened these groups have become, how they have multiplied, and how easily they spew hatred against women and use religion to justify their hatred. Now, under the guise of freedom of expression and emboldened by a tacit indulgence from the government, they are amplifying the voices of hate and drowning out the voices of reason. This is tragic considering the mandate with which this government came to power: to lead the country to democracy and freedom. The enthusiasm with which the chief adviser accepted the final report of the Women's Affairs Reform Commission was unquestionable. One could not mistake the obvious delight on the faces in that photo-op with the commission members that included prominent rights activists. The chief adviser even instructed all relevant ministries and divisions to act swiftly on the commission's recommendations aimed at ending gender discrimination. He said, ""This is not merely a women's issue; it is a matter of national significance. The report will be printed, widely distributed, and published in book form, like a textbook, to ensure accessibility."" All this pointed to real change, and nothing could have been more refreshing. So, when the commission was viciously reviled at a rally called by Hefazat-e-Islam, which demanded its total demolition because they deemed certain recommendations to be against religion, the least that was expected was a statement of condemnation from the one person you would think was a great champion of women's rights: Prof Muhammad Yunus. But this did not happen even though this was a commission that he had wanted and thought was so necessary. Other groups have also asked for the commission and its recommendations to be scrapped. This wholesale dismissal of the work of a commission, which has painstakingly chalked out possible ways to remove various kinds of discrimination that impedes women's fundamental rights, demonstrates a political agenda: to create a narrative that religion is being attacked. Apart from the fact that one of the most contentious recommendations, which was to do with equal inheritance rights, has been provided as an option rather than compulsory, the outburst of rage from certain groups was both exaggerated and unnecessary. Like in all the other commissions, these are just proposals and are open to discussions with various stakeholders. Holding mammoth rallies and publicly denouncing a commission and humiliating its members was completely unwarranted and created an unsafe, hostile environment for women. The silence continued when Nadira Yeasmin, assistant professor of Bangla at Narsingdi Government College, was made officer on special duty (OSD) because she had advocated equal inheritance rights for men and women through an online magazine she edits and publishes. Groups including Hefazat demonstrated on the college campus demanding her dismissal, claiming that her views contradict Islamic inheritance laws. And shockingly, she was made OSD and transferred to Satkhira. So why didn't the interim government, or more importantly its chief, who has always stood up for women's rights, intervene and stop this injustice? How much influence do these groups have that they get the administration to professionally punish a teacher merely for her expressing an opinion? If this is freedom of expression, we would like to know why this freedom is the privilege of only those who hide their hate in religious rhetoric. It seems if you can invoke religion, you can say the vilest, most undemocratic words in human language. But that is not all. It looks like groups that have politicised religion have the power to trash a women's affairs reform commission, transfer teachers, change vice-chancellors, and even change the history of this nation. Our constitution, the one born out of a bloody, hard-won independence, states explicitly in Article 28 (2), ""Women shall have equal rights with men in all spheres of the State and of public life."" If it is democracy that this interim government is working towards, they must ardently uphold this principle and loudly object when it is being violated. It is the least we can expect from a leader as progressive as Prof Yunus. Aasha Mehreen Amin is joint editor at The Daily Star.
